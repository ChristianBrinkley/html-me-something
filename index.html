                    "In 2012 I drove with my scout troop up to lake Superior in Michigan and hiked 50 miles along the Superior Hiking Trail.
                    We backpacked for 6 days hiking about 8 or 9 miles a day."

                    "In 2015 my scout troop took a trip to Colorado. During the trip we backpacked up to a mountain lake near the continental
                    divide. We then took a day hike up to the top of a mountain on the continental divide. "

                <p>
                    "In 2016 my family visited Germany. During our trip we traveled to Berchtesgaden which is located in 
                    southern Germany in the Bavarian Alps. We hiked 18 miles total over 3 days. Instead of traditional 
                    backpacking we did hut to hut hiking where we stayed in "huts" which are cabins with bunks in them."

                <p>
                    "In 2017 my family took a trip to Colorado. Our backpacking trip started by riding the train between 
                    Silverton and Durango. We got off the train halfway between the two cities at the trailhead. We then 
                    hiked 5 miles up into the basin. The next day we hiked up to the lake in the bowl between the four mountains 
                    that make up the basin. On our final day we hiked out of the basin and caught the train on it's way to Silverton 
                    In the same place Where we got off."
